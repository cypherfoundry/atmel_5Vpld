# Overview
This is an attempt to utilize https://github.com/JensRestemeier/EdifTests to generate an visualization from an EDIF file generated by the Atmel CPLD fitter for the ATF150x chips.
There are currently some minor issues in Spydrnet which prevent it from parsing files from the Atmel Fitter.
The problem actually seems to be in the 'spydrnet' project. See https://github.com/byuccl/spydrnet/issues/215 for more information.

Since Spydrnet can trivially convert EDIF to Verilog, included <code>edif2v.py</code> is an example of how to get Spydrnet to do this.

# Requirements
You will need:
<code>
pip install spydrnet
sudo apt-get install python3-graphviz
</code>

# Usage
In order to get EDIF out of the Atmel fitter, you might want to include the following in your .PLD file if you are working in CUPL:
<code>
PROPERTY ATMEL { out_edif=on };
</code>

# Broken Test case (EDIF generated by Atmel Fitter)
edif2dot.py ediftest.edn

# Working test case
edif2dot.py minimal.edf
