# Overview
This is an attempt to utilize https://github.com/JensRestemeier/EdifTests to generate an visualization of an EDIF file generated by the Atmel CPLD fitter for the ATF150x chips.
The problem actually seems to be in the 'spydrnet' project.

# Requirements
You will need:
<code>
pip install spydrnet
sudo apt-get install python3-graphviz
</code>

# Broken Test case (EDIF generated by Atmel Fitter)
edif2dot.py ediftest.edn

# Working test case
edif2dot.py minimal.edf
