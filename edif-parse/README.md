# Overview
This is an attempt to utilize https://github.com/JensRestemeier/EdifTests to generate an visualization and/or Verilog from an EDIF file generated by the Atmel CPLD fitter for the ATF150x chips.
There are currently some minor issues in spydrnet which prevent it from parsing files from 
The problem actually seems to be in the 'spydrnet' project. See https://github.com/byuccl/spydrnet/issues/215 for more information.

Additionally, <code>edif2v.py</code> is an example of how to get spydrnet to create a Verilog file from your EDIF.

# Requirements
You will need:
<code>
pip install spydrnet
sudo apt-get install python3-graphviz
</code>

# Usage
In order to get EDIF out of the Atmel fitter, you might want to include the following in your .PLD file if you are working in CUPL:
<code>
PROPERTY ATMEL { out_edif=on };
</code>

# Broken Test case (EDIF generated by Atmel Fitter)
