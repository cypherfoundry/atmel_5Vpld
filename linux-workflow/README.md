5vcomp is a Linux Shell Script that is a light wrapper around CUPL.EXE<br>
CUPL.EXE will runs well under Linux using Wine and enables one to use a command-line/scripted approach to compilation.<br>
It checks for some common problems and otherwise allows one to completely avoid having to use WinCUPL.
